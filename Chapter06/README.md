# Distributed Training
## Notebook 1 - Distributed Data Parallel Training on Amazon SageMaker 
### 1_distributed_data_parallel_training.ipynb
In this notebook we will use a Visual transformer to do image classification `horse or human` data from https://laurencemoroney.com/datasets.html. 
We will download both training and validation dataset provided on the site. Before you begin, please make sure to use following kernel and notebook instances in Amazon SageMaker Studio. 

**Note** : 
- Kernel: `PyTorch 1.8 Python 3.6 CPU Optimized)`
- Instance Type: `ml.m5.xlarge`

## Notebook 2 - Distributed Model Parallel Training on Amazon SageMaker 
### 2_distributed_model_parallel_training.ipynb
