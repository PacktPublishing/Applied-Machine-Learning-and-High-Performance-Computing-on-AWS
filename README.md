This is the code repository for [Applied Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing on AWS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/Applied-Machine-Learning-and-High-Performance-Computing-on-AWS/9781803237015?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803237015), published by Packt.

**Accelerate the development of machine learning applications following architectural best practices**

## What is this book about?
Machine learning (ML) and high-performance computing (HPC) on AWS run compute-intensive workloads across industries and emerging applications. Its use cases can be linked to various verticals, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), genomics, and autonomous vehicles.		

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore data management, storage, and fast networking for HPC applications
* Focus on the analysis and visualization of a large volume of data using Spark
* Train visual transformer models using SageMaker distributed training
* Deploy and manage ML models at scale on the cloud and at the edge
* Get to grips with performance optimization of ML models for low latency workloads
* Apply HPC to industry domains such as CFD, genomics, AV, and optimization

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np
import json

with open("horse_cart.jpg", "rb") as f:
   payload = f.read()
   payload = bytearray(payload)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
The book begins with HPC concepts, however, it expects you to have prior machine learning knowledge. This book is for ML engineers and data scientists interested in learning advanced topics on using large datasets for training large models using distributed training concepts on AWS, deploying models at scale, and performance optimization for low latency use cases. Practitioners in fields such as numerical optimization, computation fluid dynamics, autonomous vehicles, and genomics, who require HPC for applying ML models to applications at scale will also find the book useful.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).

### Software and Hardware List
